      <p><i>The Woke Windows Project</i> consists of many data tables and types. This data is pulled from multiple sources.</p>
      <p>When you are viewing any type of record, e.g. an incident report or an employee, there will be a section <i>Source Materials</i>. This section lists the data sources from which this record was derived and provides links to them. You can use these original sources to confirm any information from the Woke Windows Project.</p>
      <p>Do you have questions? Advice? Compliments or critiques? Please reach out to us at <%= contact_us %>. Any and all feedback is welcome.</p>

      <h2 id="articles">Articles</h2>
      <p>We provide links from each <a href="#officers">officer record</a> to different news articles and publications referencing that officer. Most of these links were generated using an automated process that looks for instances of the officer's name in a selection of articles. This selection is limited to articles that mention or are about the Boston Police Department. This process is not 100% reliable; in certain cases (e.g. if another person mentioned in the article happens to share a name with an officer), an officer may be linked to an article that does not in-fact mention them.</p>
      <p>In addition to the automatic process, some articles have been manually added. If an article was manually added, or if it is an automatically added article that has been confirmed by a human being, a green checkmark <span class="text-success">&check;</span> is shown next to the article in the articles table. If the article was automatically added and has not been confirmed, it is shown with a gray checkmark <span class="text-muted">?</span></p>

      <h3 id="complaints">Complaints (Internal Affairs)</h3>
      <p>Internal Affairs cases include both citizen complaints, where a member of the community files a complaint regarding the conduct of an officer or a civilian employee of the BPD, and internal investigations. We source this data from a number of sources: <a href="#bpd_ia_data_2001_2011">2001 to 2011 IA data</a>, <a href="#allegations_2010_to_2020">2010 to 2020 Allegations</a>, and <a href="#2014_officer_ia_log">2014 Officer IA Log</a>.</p>
      <p>A case is identified by a unique number e.g. <i>IAD2019-0412</i>. An individual case may involve one-or-more employees, each with one-or-more allegations. A finding is made for each allegation against each officer.</p>
      <p>For the vast majority of cases, we only have the general nature of the allegations e.g. <i>Neg.Duty/Unreasonable Judge</i>. For a subset of the cases from 2014, we also have prose summaries (redacted).</p>
      <p>The list of complaints that appears on the officer page (see the <%= link_to "Commissioner Gross", officer_path("9018") %> page for an example of an officer's page) is linked based on matching the name of the officer to that listed in the complaint. We make efforts to not link ambiguous cases where two officers have very similar names (or the exact same name!) but it's possible a mislink could happen. It's wise to look to the original source data to confirm.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the listing of complaints on the officer page may not be comprehensive; there may be cases we failed to link the officer to. To find these, try searching the <%= link_to "complaints table", complaints_path %> for variations of the officer's name.</p>

      <h4 id="ia_score">IA Score</h4>
      <p>We calculate a score from 0 - 5 that indicates the severity of the Internal Affairs cases opened against an officer. This score is defined and calculated by The Woke Windows Project. The algorithm which calculates the score and the classification of allegations was invented by us.</p>

      <h3 id="field_contacts">Field Contacts (FIO)</h3>
      <p>Field Interrogation and Observation (FIO) reports are how the BPD records the department's stop-and-frisk encounters (and other encouters, many of which do not involve a search).</p>
      <p>Per <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5086f19ce4b0ad16ff15598d/t/56a2569205caa7ee9f29e6a2/1453479570208/rule323.pdf">Rule 323</a>: "An FIOE Report shall be submitted subsequent to a field interaction/stop, a frisk, an observation, or an encounter".</p>
      <p>We ingest the cleaned <a href="#bpd_fio_data">BPD FIO Data</a> provided at <a href="https://github.com/jacoblurye/bpd-fio-data">jacoblurye/bpd-fio-data</a> (thanks <a href="https://github.com/jacoblurye">@jacoblurye</a>!) That data was sourced from the <a href="#field_contact">FieldContact Table</a> and <a href="#field_contact_name">FieldContact_Name</a> exports distributed on the <a href="https://data.boston.gov/">Analyze Boston website</a>.</p>
      <p>These reports are especially interesting because they 1. contain redacted prose narratives of the encounter and 2. contain a breakdown of the race and ethnicity of the individuals involved.</p>
      <p>If the <i>Frisked / Searched?</i> flag is <i>Yes</i>, this indicates that at least one of the stopped persons was searched. Beginning in September 2019, the search flag is also marked for each individual.</p>

      <h3 id="incidents">Incident Journal</h3>
      <p>When an officer responds to a call, carries out a search warrant, or otherwise performs a significant action, they fill out an incident report (sometimes referred to as Form 1.1). The BPD makes available a selection of fields from these reports through two public data sources: <a href="#crime_incident_reports">Crime Incident Reports</a> and <a href="#district_journal">Public Journal</a>. In addition, reports from 2012 - 2015 are taken from the <a href="#legacy_crime_incident_reports">Legacy Crime Incident Reports</a>.  We combine these data sources to create the list of incidents on this site.</p>
      <p>We automatically import new incident reports from these data sources on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>It's not clear if all incident reports are included in these public data sources, or if some sensitive categories are being filtered out. In addition, the routinely published information only captures a subset of the fields an officer enters when they submit these reports.</p>
      <p>A full incident report contains information about the people involved and a written narrative of events. Due to privacy concerns, the department will not release a full report without first applying redactions.</p>
      <p>To see the difference between a full report and what's available on this site, contrast the <a href="/downloads/172068118_PkvQylJ.pdf">full (redacted) report</a> for incident #172068118 and <a href="<%= incident_path('172068118') %>">our record</a> for that same incident.</p>

      <h3 id="details">Paid Details</h3>
      <p>A paid detail is when an officer is paid by a private company to direct traffic (e.g. around roadwork by a utility company) or to provide security. These companies put in a request for a police detail with the department, and then officers sign up for these shifts in addition to their regular hours.</p>
      <p>We currently only have records for the year 2019. This data is sourced from <a href="#detail_records">Detail Records 2019</a>.</p>
      <p>The contract between the department and the police unions stipulates that an officer is paid for a minimum of four hours of work, regardless of the number of hours actually worked. This rule among others explains the discrepancy between <i>Hours Worked</i> and <i>Pay Hours</i> you will see when browsing these records.</p>
      <p>For more information regarding department policies for paid details, see <a href="https://bpdnews.com/s/Rule-325.pdf">Rule 325</a> and <a href="https://bpdnews.com/s/Rule-326.pdf">Rule 326</a>.</p>


      <h3 id="officers">Officers &amp; Employees</h3>
      <p>Our goal is to present information regarding every sworn officer of the Boston Police Department. We also include some data on civilian employees of the department, but this is a lower priority. In order to link the data together effectively across multiple data sources, and to ensure we do not have duplicate entries, we only create records for those persons where we have the six-digit City of Boston employee id number.</p>
      <p>We currently harvest the employee id number from two sources: <a href="#alpha_listing">BPD Alpha Listing with Badges</a> and <a href="#district_journal">Public Journal</a>. If a particular employee does not exist in any of these sources, they will not be listed on this site.</p>
      <p>On the page for each employee (see the page for <%= link_to "Commissioner Gross", officer_path("9018") %> as an example) the officer's annual earnings are broken down by category. The data for this report is sourced from the <a href="#employee_earnings">Employee Earnings Reports</a> produced by the City of Boston Office of Human Resources. The HR office supplies <a href="https://data.boston.gov/dataset/employee-earnings-report/resource/609a6014-5ab0-49d9-8c38-1389e7bf0d41">this explanation</a> of the different categories.</p>
      <p>Detail pay deserves special mention. This is pay earned by working paid details under the procedures described in <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5086f19ce4b0ad16ff15598d/t/52af60cfe4b007c7c2257da2/1387225295091/Rule+325.pdf">Rule 325</a>. The city should be receiving compensation from the private business that requested the detail.</p>
      <h4 id="officer_zip_code">Zip Code and Neighborhood</h4>
      <p>The zip code where the officer lives is taken from the most recent <a href="#employee_earnings">Employee Earnings Report</a> on which the officer appears. The state and neighborhood fields are calculated based on the zip code. The mapping of zip codes to neighborhoods was taken from the <a href="http://www.bostonplans.org/getattachment/8d4b1dc5-ce11-45b4-9bf5-370444b49b68">Boston Business Patterns 2016</a> report.</p>

      <h3 id="cases">Forfeiture Cases</h3>
      <p>This information is currently imported from a single source: <a href="#da_forfeitures">Forfeitures by Suffolk District Attorney.</a></p>

      <h3 id="swats">SWAT Reports</h3>
      <p>We have redacted SWAT incident reports covering 2010 - 2014 from <a href="#swat">17F SWAT After-Action Reports</a>. These reports were provided as several-hundred page PDF documents, each spanning an entire year. We've broken each incident out into an individual file, and we've run <a href="https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF">OCRmyPDF</a> on those individual files.</p>
      <p>We automatically discover the officers involved in each action based on their names and employee ids. Because the OCR process is not 100% reliable, there may be errors and/or omissions in the fields we parse out.</p>

      <h3 id="citations">Traffic Citations</h3>
      <p>These records show tickets written by Boston Police Department officers using the Massachusetts Uniform Citation form. These tickets are submitted to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) either electronically or on paper (in which case they are scanned and the data is entered).</p>
      <p>This data comes from the <a href="#2019_tickets">2019 Traffic Tickets Data Source</a>.</p>

        Since September 2019, the Boston Police Department has submitted incident data to the FBI's 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Incident-Based_Reporting_System">National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS)</a>. 
        Obtained through a public records request, this dataset provides additional incident information not tracked in the BPD's 
        <a href="#crime_incident_reports">Crime Incident Reports</a>.
        <a>
      </p>
      <p>The City of Boston has made only the data for September 2019 through December 2019 available. Data for 2020 will not be available until 2021.</p>
      <p>Like the <a href="#crime_incident_reports">Crime Incident Reports</a> dataset, each row in the original dataset corresponds to a single offense. An incident may include multiple offenses.</p>
      <p>Note: the original dataset includes additional columns that Woke Windows does not yet ingest.</p>

      <p>This is a PDF document showing Internal Affairs cases over a ten year period. It is formatted in a manner which makes the document almost impossible to use as is; the values for each row are split across three pages. To get the complete first row, for example, you need to combine the data on pages 1, 168, and 335.</p>
      <p>We've already done the work to create a file combining each row onto a single line. You can download that file here: <a href="/downloads/bpd_ia_data_2001_2011.zip">bpd_ia_data_2001_2011.zip</a></p>

      <p>We are not currently importing the 2010 and 2011 Superior Court files because some of the tables in these files need to be OCR'd.</p>
      <p>We only import records where there is a docket number for the case, this means we are not importing nearly half of the records in these files.</p>
      <p>We convert the docket numbers to the new formats described on <a href="https://www.mass.gov/search-court-dockets-calendars-and-case-information">this page</a> under the <i>Case numbering formats</i> heading.</p>
