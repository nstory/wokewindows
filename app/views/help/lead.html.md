The Law Enforcement Automatic Discovery (LEAD) database is the Suffolk County District Attorney's implementation of a "Brady list." This is a list of law enforcement personnel who have been accused of misconduct. As part of [Brady disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_disclosure), the district attorney must inform a defendant when a law enforcement official involved in their case has a history of dishonesty; this list ensures that disclosure is made.

If an officer is named in this list, The Woke Windows Project displays that information on the officer's page.
